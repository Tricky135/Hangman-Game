# THE HANGMAN'S GAME
This project is a simple word guessing minigame.

The Hangman Game is a simple console based word minimgame where the user has to guess the word by considering the hints and the number of blank spaces provided.
In each try the user can either enter a character or the entire word. Every correct letter guessed, fills out the blanks with that letter (multiple 
blanks if that letter exists in multiple locations). With more blanks filled, the guessing becomes easier, so start trying with the letters which occur
more often in words like vowels. There are 3 difficulty levels- easy, moderate and difficult where these levels have lower tries at higher difficulty.
You win the game by guessing the correct word. Its a simple yet renouned game. Hope you like it. Enjoy!
