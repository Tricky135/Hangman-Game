# The Hangman's Game
A text-based hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word.

(i). Abstract :- The Hangman's Game is a text-based word-guessing game where players try to uncover a hidden word chosen by the computer. The player selects a difficulty level that determines the number of guesses allowed. They then guess letters or the entire word, with each incorrect guess reducing the number of tries. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or exhausts their guesses. Players can choose to play multiple rounds.

(ii). Instructions :- To play Hangman's Game, start by entering your name and choosing a difficulty level, which sets the number of allowed guesses. The computer will select a random word and display its length. Guess letters one at a time or attempt to guess the entire word. If a guessed letter is correct, it will reveal the letter in the word; if incorrect, you lose a guess. Continue guessing until you either correctly identify the word or run out of guesses. After a game, you can choose to play again or exit.

(iii). Future Scope :- This is a simple console based hangman game. This can be considered as a prototype which can be upgraded to improve its functionality. For example, It can have a GUI built using tkinter to give it a fresh and refined look for a better gaming experience. Along with that, this game can also have more words in its pool and a better hint system to increase the chances of the players. Adding a database for score and highscore might also improve the quality of the game.
